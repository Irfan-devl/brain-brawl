#BrainBrawl: The AI-Powered Smart Revision Platform

Welcome to BrainBrawl, an innovative AI-powered platform designed to transform static study materials into dynamic, engaging quiz battles. By leveraging advanced AI and gamification, BrainBrawl aims to improve student engagement, knowledge retention, and academic performance.

#Project Overview

In todayâ€™s digital learning landscape, traditional study materials often fail to capture students' attention. BrainBrawl addresses this by transforming any uploaded document, such as a PDF, into a dynamic quiz experience. Our platform goes beyond standard quizzes by introducing gamification through real-time battles where learners compete against peers on the same content.

#Key Features

AI-Powered Question Generation: The heart of BrainBrawl is an intelligent system that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract knowledge from uploaded documents and generate contextually accurate multiple-choice questions.

High-Quality Distractors: The system is designed to generate plausible, but incorrect, answer options (distractors) to create challenging and effective quizzes.

Dynamic Quiz Battles: Students can join real-time battle rooms to compete against friends or other learners. This feature is powered by low-latency communication technology like WebSockets for a seamless experience.

Gamified Learning: The platform features live leaderboards, time-limited challenges, and an adaptive difficulty system that adjusts questions based on a student's performance.

Offline-First Capability: BrainBrawl is designed to be accessible in regions with limited internet bandwidth. It supports offline functionality, allowing students to engage with quizzes and syncing their progress later when a connection is available.

#Technical Methodology

Our project combines cutting-edge AI with robust web development practices:

AI Engine: The core AI uses a RAG pipeline to generate questions. This involves preprocessing documents, creating text embeddings in a vector store, and using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce accurate, contextually relevant questions and distractors.

Backend Architecture: The platform's real-time features are built using an architecture that leverages technologies like WebSockets for efficient, full-duplex communication. We have considered a P2P communication model using WebRTC to further enhance performance and reduce latency.

Quality Assurance: To ensure the quality of our generated content, we have developed a robust evaluation framework. This includes using AI item-writing guidelines and metrics like a discrimination index and difficulty score to validate that our questions are pedagogically sound.
